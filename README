mrtg_parse() takes three argument:
        
        1st:  filename of the mrtg logfile
        2nd:  time period to genereate the output for
              valid values are:   
                                 - individual time periods like: 20040821-20050130 (ISO 8601)
                                 - static values:                day, month, year
        3rd:  the desired unit (optional)
              valid values are: 
                                 - B, KB, MB, GB, TB 
                                 - if missing mrtg_parse will chose an adequate one for you
